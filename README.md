# How to play
Play against a computer player as the Code Maker or the Code Breaker.

When playing as the Code Maker, select a code with 4 colors and watch the
computer player try to break it!

When playing as the Code Breaker, try to guess the computer's secret code.
Every guess you make will produce some clues on the right side of the row that you just guessed.
    1.) Red circles indicate that a peg is the correct color and in the right location
    2.) White circles indicate that a peg is the correct color but in the wrong location

Enjoy!
